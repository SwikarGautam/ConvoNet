# ConvoNet
A machine learning framework for implementing Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and deep fully connected 
neural network implemented using numpy only. It has many features for accelerated and optimized learning process like batch normalization, dropout, L2 regularization
and adam optimizer.I created it to learn more about nuts and bolts of Neural network and I hope it helps you know more about them as well.
